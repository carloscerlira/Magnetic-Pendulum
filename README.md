# Magnetic Pendulum
A numerical solution for the equations of motion governing the behavior of a magnetic pendulum was found, this system is of interest as it is known to be chaotic.  
The numerical solution was performed for every pixel of a nxn image using parallel computing with the help of CUDA, NVIDIA's API.  
The complexity of the problem was reduced from O(n^2) using brute force to O(1)
